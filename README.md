# Propus Engine

Propus is a report generation engine for nodejs. (in development)

## Motivation

When doing a personal project, I noticed there wasn't any optimal solutions for report generation in Nodejs. Some tools existed, but nothing comparable with what I saw in other languages.
This project aims to develop good functionality to do more complex reports that would otherwise create the need for a separate service in other language on the project architecture.

## Building and running

As this tool is a package, there's nothing to run in a standalone manner, but there are the examples, that are used to test the project.

To run the example that uses datasets in development mode, execute:

```bash
ts-node example/solicitations.js
```
